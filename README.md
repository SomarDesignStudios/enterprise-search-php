## Getting started 🐣

Using this client assumes that you have a [Enterprise Search](https://www.elastic.co/enterprise-search) server installed and running.

You can install the client in your project by using composer:

```bash
composer require elastic/enterprise-search
```

### Versioning

 This client is versioned and released alongside Enterprise Search.

 To guarantee compatibility, use the most recent version of this library within the major version of the corresponding Enterprise Search implementation.

 For example, for Enterprise Search `7.4`, use `7.4` of this library or above, but not `8.0`.
